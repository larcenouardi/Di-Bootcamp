<ul>



    <li> Exercise 1 : Evaluation  </li>
        <ul>


            5 >= 1    : is true because 5 is greater than or equal to 1.  <br>
            0 === 1   : is false because the triple equals operator checks for both value and type equality, and 0 and 1 have different values. <br>
            4 <= 1    : is false because 4 is not less than or equal to 1. <br>
            1 != 1    : is false because 1 is equal to 1, and the != operator checks for inequality.  <br>
            "A" > "B"  :  is true because in the ASCII character set, "A" has a greater value than "B".  <br>
            "B" < "C"  : is true because in the ASCII character set, "B" has a smaller value than "C".  <br>
            "b" < "A"  : is false because in the ASCII character set, "b" has a greater value than "A".  <br>
             true === false   : is false because true and false have different boolean values.  <br>
            true != true    : is false because true is equal to true, and the != operator checks for inequality.  <br>

        </ul>
